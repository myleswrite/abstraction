# abstraction

A Python script to work through a sitemap and see / save the meta descriptions. Really just a playground for me to learn a bit of Python at the moment.

## What does abstraction do?

+ Firstly it asks for the URL of a valid sitemap
+ Secondly it checks every URL in the sitemap and logs the meta description (if there is one)
+ Finally it (optionally) saves a JSON and CSV of the meta descriptions

And that's it really. Like I said, it's just a way for me to learn a bit of Python.
